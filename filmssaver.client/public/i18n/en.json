Over the past several years, I have worked professionally with technologies such as C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, Angular, HTML, CSS, Entity Framework, WPF, and Git. Throughout my career, I have contributed to projects at companies like Ebps Logistics, Lanit, ISBC, and ITGlobal, actively participating in both frontend and backend development for complex enterprise solutions. I also have hands-on experience with DevExpress, jQuery, Blazor, WinForms, and a working familiarity with C++ and Linux. My workflow is characterized by responsibility, reliability, and a strong team spirit, supported by tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Azure DevOps. I value clear communication, efficient time management, and continuous learningâ€”particularly in modern technologies like Angular. I hold a degree in Microelectronics and Software Engineering from MIET University, with an internationally recognized diploma. Since 2023, I have been living in Austria, where I continue to grow professionally and deepen my expertise in software development."
